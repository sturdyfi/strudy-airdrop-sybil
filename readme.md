## Reporting Sybil attacker addresses

To report a group of Sybil attacker addresses, create an issue on this repo and use the "Sybil Attacker Report" template.

Rules:
* Reports will be reviewed on a first-come, first serve basis
* The methodology must be well explained and easy to understand
* Self-reports are permitted
* Reports using a methodology that has a non-negligible chance of eliminating legitimate users will not be considered

Thank you to [Hop](https://hop.exchange/) for the inspiration and template!
